## ðŸ“¢: Shout-outs
The architecture of our method is inspired by [ConvONet](https://github.com/autonomousvision/convolutional_occupancy_networks), [Taming-transformers](https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers) and [DCTransformer](https://github.com/benjs/DCTransformer-PyTorch).
Thanks to the authors.
